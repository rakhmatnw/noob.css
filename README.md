# Noob CSS
This is a simple, not fancy at all, mini CSS Framework. A noob framework created by noob

I made this little framework **not to compete** with other frameworks out there (duh.)  

This project is just a medium for me to **learn**, because I prefer to learn by building something.

## Progress
The components of this framework is still limited. Here's several things I've created:
* Layout
  * Container
* Content
  * Typography
  * Tables
* Components
  * Buttons
  * Forms

## What is my goals by creating this?
* Learn more about how to style HTML built-in  components and make custom components
* Become more comfortable writing SASS/SCSS with all of its features
* Learn more about best practices such as modularity and naming convention
