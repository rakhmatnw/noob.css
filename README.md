# Kecik CSS
"Kecik" means small . This is a simple, not fancy at all, mini CSS UI Framework. 

I made this little framework **not to compete** with other frameworks out there. 
But this project is just a medium for me to **learn**.

* Basic syntax
* SASS variable and maps
* SASS Conditial Statement
